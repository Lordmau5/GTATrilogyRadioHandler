# GTATrilogyRadioHandler
A small tool that un-/mutes specific programs through the Windows volume mixer when the player is / isn't in a vehicle

# Usage
1. Go ingame at least once (New Game, Loaded Game, etc. - basically walking around)
2. Start the tool
3. Select which game you are playing
4. If the buttons for the games stay grayed out, it's hooked and you can start playing
5. It will mute the listed programs when on-foot, and un-mute them when in a car

# Supported programs
- Anything you add via. the list (in theory)

# TODO
- Dialog for periodic hook check so it can be started without having to ingame at least once
    - Waiting for game...
    - Button: Cancel Hook
- More testing? idk
