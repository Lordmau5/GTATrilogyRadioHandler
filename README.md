A small tool that un-/mutes specific programs through the Windows volume mixer when the player is / isn't in a vehicle


# Usage
1. Go ingame at least once (New Game, Loaded Game, etc. - basically walking around)
2. Start the tool
3. Select which game you are playing
4. If the buttons stay grayed out, it's hooked and you can start playing
5. It will mute the music when on-foot, and un-mute when in a car
